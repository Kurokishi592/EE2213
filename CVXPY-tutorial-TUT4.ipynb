    "# Introduction to CVXPY for Optimization\n",
    "\n",
    "Welcome to this tutorial on `CVXPY`, a Python-embedded modeling language for convex optimization problems. If you're familiar with linear programming, `CVXPY` takes that concept and expands it to a much broader class of problems known as convex optimization. This notebook will guide you through the basics of using `CVXPY` to solve both linear programming and more general convex optimization problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "**What is Optimization?**\n",
    "\n",
    "Optimization is about making the best possible choice from a set of available alternatives. In mathematics, this often means finding the minimum or maximum of a function, subject to certain constraints.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why CVXPY?**\n",
    "\n",
    "`CVXPY` allows you to express your optimization problems in a natural, mathematical syntax directly within Python. It then uses powerful underlying solvers to find the solutions. This makes it incredibly flexible and easy to use for a wide range of applications, from machine learning to finance and engineering.\n",
