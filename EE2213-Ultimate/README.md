# EE2211-Ultimate-Cheatsheet
The most precious thing in EE2211 exam is time.
This pythion program is an integration of nearly every method taught in EE2211. It allows me to finish my exams 30 minutes faster (30 minutes for reviewing, redoing hard problems, and getting more points!).


All the methods such as linear regression, polynomial regression, ridge regression, etc. are used as different functions in the main.py file. Just comment out and uncomment different lines, and the program works at your command. 


Want to know how it works? Take a look! Even if you are building your own programs, hope this gives you some inspiration! (click the image below to view a short intro video)
